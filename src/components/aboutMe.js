      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>I am a childcare teacher who was previously an electronics engineer. 
        Before I became a childcare teacher, I worked in Penang for approximately one and a half years and moved to Singapore to work in a fab for about four years.
        As a side note, I am a Malaysian :)</p>
      <h3>Why do I Want to Join TechLadies Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>So, why do I want to be part of TechLadies Bootcamp 4?
        First and foremost, I have built trust in TechLadies after attending a few TechLadies events such as.....
        Most importantly, I feel connected to the project of Bootcamp 4.
        Last year, the Bootcamp 3 was about Ruby on Rails which I knew nothing about it and I was intimidated by the technical task.
        ....
        However, this year it is about Javascript which is not total stranger to me because I have been taking online courses to learn bits of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        I want to be a front-end web developer and I really hope that I can achieve this goal through TechLadies Bootcamp 4.</p>
